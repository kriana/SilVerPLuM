Point your cursor at something and press F1 to see live info about it. Find out a villager's favourite gifts, when a crop will be ready to harvest, how long a fence will last, why your farm animals are unhappy, and more (see screenshots). Works on things in the world, in your inventory, or birthdays in the calendar.

## Configure

The mod works fine out of the box, but you can tweak its settings in the config.json file. Here's what you can change:

* Keyboard: set keyboard bindings. The default values are F1 to lookup, and Up/Down to scroll. See valid keys.
* Controller: set controller bindings. No buttons configured by default. See valid buttons.
* CheckForUpdates: Default true. Whether to check for a newer version when you load the game. If a new version is available, you'll see a small message at the bottom of the screen for a few seconds. This doesn't affect the load time even if your connection is offline or slow, because it happens in the background.
* HideOnKeyUp: Default false. If enabled, the lookup window will be shown while you hold F1 and disappear when you release it.
* DebugLog: Default true. Logs more information to the SMAPI console to make troubleshooting easier.
* SuppressGameDebug: Default true. Disables SMAPI's F2 debug hotkey, which can have unintended consequences like skipping an entire season or teleporting into walls. See SMAPI issue #120.
