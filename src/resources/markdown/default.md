# Welcome to SilVerPLuM
With SilVerPLuM you can manage profiles, mods and savegames for Stardew Valley.

## Getting started

SilVerPLuM needs to know the location of Stardew Valley from you. Go to the 'Configure' tab and select the correct folder. Also check if the programs listed in 'Application settings' are available.

## Modify your game

You can find mods in the [Stardew Valley modding forum](http://community.playstarbound.com/forums/mods.215/) and the [Stardew Valley mod repository](http://community.playstarbound.com/resources/categories/stardew-valley.22/). [Nexus Mods](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/) also offers a place where you can get mods.
SilVerPLuM has its own format for mods and cannot directly read mods that are not in the SilVerPLuM mod package format. For most mods, you can use the mod importer to load mods into SilVerPLuM. Check out the [tutorial](https://github.com/rumangerst/SilVerPLuM/wiki/Modding-tutorial:-Use-the-mod-importer) how to use it.

SilVerPLuM comes with an integrated feature that allows you to download mods online, although you need a mod containing download sources.

## Integrate into Steam

If you want Steam achievements and other Steam features, you can set up Steam to start SilVerPLuM. Check out the [tutorial](https://github.com/rumangerst/SilVerPLuM/wiki/Tutorial:-Steam-overlay-and-achievements) how to do this.
