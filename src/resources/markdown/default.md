# Welcome to SilVerPLuM
With SilVerPLuM you can manage profiles, mods and savegames for Stardew Valley.

## Getting started

SilVerPLuM needs to know the location of Stardew Valley from you. Go to the 'Configure' tab and select the correct folder. Also check if the programs listed in 'Application settings' are available.

## Modify

You can find mods in the [Stardew Valley modding forum](http://community.playstarbound.com/forums/mods.215/) and the [Stardew Valley mod repository](http://community.playstarbound.com/resources/categories/stardew-valley.22/). Just download the \*.zip file and add the mod in the 'Modify' tab.
But don't forget that the mod must support SilVerPLuM and your current Stardew Valley version.

There may also be ready-to-use SilVerPLuM profiles with included mods.

## Manage

SilVerPLuM allows you to easily create backups of your savegames, as well as importing and exporting them. There also is an integrated auto-backup that can be activated in the 'Configuration' tab. The profile management encapsulates savegames and mods into their own profiles, so you can experiment with new mods without breaking something.
